      <h4 class="s-title">Overview</h4>
      <p class="wcw">"I think all writing is a disease. You can't stop it." - William Carlos Williams</p>
      <p>Currently there are 281 300 authors, writers, and editors employed in the United States. There are amateur writers working to break
          into journalism or selling a first novel. Writers who spend their free time spinning a tale for fun. Students
          learning the craft in creative and professional writing programs.</p>
      <p>Cloud Storage is dominated by titans. Google. Microsoft. Dropbox. During my competitive research, I found their audience is anybody who needs to save
        something on the internet. An opportunity we found really cater to the needs of a particular audience, in this case - writers. 
        WritingCloud meets the needs of its writers by giving them a place to write, collaborate, and research.</p>

        <h4 class="s-title">Challenge</h4>
          <p class="pcloud">Most cloud storages serve a diverse customer base. Focusing on a particular audience we could meet the needs of
            many users with similar needs and pain points. In the existing market, there is a frustration in collaboration
            among users who don't use the same platform, unclear file sharing, and greater need for a cooperative writing
            space. All of this can be accomplished with WritingCloud's intuitive dashboard.</p>
        <h4 class="s-title">Solution</h4>
          <p>Focusing on a specified audience means refining the tools for that cloud storage to fit specific needs. Easy to
            find button to upload files or create your latest writing project with a consistent action color throughout the
            design. Using an organization system that users are already familiar with using folders and files. While we have
            the image of the lonely writer holed up in an office, writing is collaborative. With editors, beta readers,
            writing groups, and publishers to work with - sharing individual files or projects is one of WritingCloud's
            primary features.</p>

        <p>I reached out to professional writers that I knew, student writers, amateur writers, and users on SurveyTandem.
          I received 39 responses. Our intended audience followed a few key patterns:</p>
        <ul class="results">
          <li>Most people wrote outside of a cloud server, so they would need a way to upload their writing files.</li>
          <li>A number of users wanted the ability to interact with others in the cloud by leaving comments, chatting in
            real time, and editing shared documents.</li>
          <li>Out of the short answer questions about how users organized their research online or off, involved some sort
            of categorization method. Many people confessed they organized poorly. I needed to have a simple method of
            organization to meet the needs of the highly organized to the not-so organized.</li>

    <h4>Low Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
    <p>To visualize the data and ideas I had accumulated, I did rough sketches of every screen from each point in my
      user flows. Sketching potential layouts allowed for my ideas to come together and to analyze potential weak
      points quickly.</p>

    </div>   <!-- group lofi -->

    <p id="lofipar">After performing some usability tests, I simplified the dashboard design and removed clutter. The folders needed to stand out in some way against the other files since users would reference folders more frequently, I adjusted the folders by bolding them to make this design feature accessible to all. The navigation on the left didn't need icons. They could stand on their own and the navigation needed to be simplified even more and reflect what I had initially built in my site map.</p>

  </section> <!-- lofi -->

  <section class="branding">
    <div class="branding-overview">
      <h4>Branding</h4>
      <p>I had a few different ideas with the logo. Some marks I drew had books in them. When I showed the designs to
        someone else in the industry, she pointed out that books could represent school or education. This pushed me
        towards writing tools like a feather or pen, so I made two logo variations one featuring a quill and the other a
        pen.</p>
      <img src="images/first-pen.png" />
      <img src="images/feather.png" />
      <p>The preference test yielded 60% in favor of the pen over the minimalist feather mark. Once I decided on the pen,
        I re-designed the logo a few times. My aim was to communicate the message of WritingCloud with the mark. The
        share logo is universally recognized so including this in the pen itself communicated the different ways
        WritingCloud could be used.</p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="colors">
     <img src="images/writingcloud-sized.png">
      <p>I narrowed down the typeface to two fonts: Lora for headings and Roboto for body text. Lora's serif-font style
        evokes the feeling of print while still maintaining a contemporary look. It could be used as a body font, keeping
        its readability high. Something I found important since more and more users simply scan a website instead of
        reading deeply.</p>
      <p>Roboto's versatility made it the ideal body font. As needed I could italicize or bold at various levels to
        highlight certain information within the text.</p>
      <p>Colors were kept soft. I pulled the orange for its association with creativity and is used on all action items
        and buttons. Teal pairs nicely with the orange and is used as a background color.</p>
      

      <div class="color-pal">

  <section class="hifi">
    <h4>High Fidelity Mock Ups</h4>
    <p>After locking down the colors, typeface, and logo I refined the mock ups in Figma. I revamped the text editor by removing unfamiliar icons and spelling out certain
      links. The chat feature looked like a help window, so I added a "chat with friends" headline to clarify.</p>
      <p>I performed preference tests on the color of the icons, with 86% of users perferring the orange icons. </p>
      <img class="preference" src="images/icontest.svg">

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p class="conclusion-p"><span>What I Learned:</span> Making assumptions about your audience will bog down your project and lead you in the wrong
      direction. Interacting with users as much as possible and getting feedback as early as possible will keep you on
      the right course. Here is what I would do if I could do this project again:</p>
    <p class="conclusion-p"><span>Updated User Survey:</span> In my initial user survey I would've added more questions asking about moments of delight
      and pain points with their current cloud storage. While I had some of those questions, my focus was on what the
      client wanted and I needed to bring more balance to the client and our prospective audience.</p>
    <p class="conclusion-p"><span>More Testing Earlier On:</span> Front loading your work can benefit you in the long run. During the low fidelity wire
      frame section, I would've down more usability testing and updated screens in that phase as well. I'd also be more
      flexible with what seemed to come naturally to users and build designs that way.</p>
