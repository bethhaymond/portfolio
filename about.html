        <div class="biography-text">
          <p>At 25, I had my first child, a boy we called Jude. He had platinum blond curls, enticing strangers to reach out to him and meet his eyes. Jude didn't look back. Milestones flew by. My son didn't have the strength to sit by himself and toppled over when other kids were already crawling. He made fleeting eye contact. He didn't babble.</p>
          <p>At 18 months-old, Jude was diagnosed with a genetic disorder called <b>Smith-Magenis Syndrome</b>, something that only affects 1 in 25,000 people. The doctor told me over the phone and sent me a link to read, on my own, all the struggles my boy would go through. Global developmental delays. Cognitive impairment. Self-injurious behavior. Aggressive outbursts. Chronic sleep disturbances.</p>
          <p>At 3, Jude climbed out of his crib. Most toddlers transition to a bed at this point but we needed something to keep Jude contained at night. I couldn't stay up all night, monitoring his outbursts and preventing him from slamming his head against the door. He tried to escape his room at night and I had a deep-seated fear that one day he'd break out of our house.</p>  
          <p><i>Enter the Safety Sleeper.</i> A regular bed with a tent-like structure attached to it. The flap has a zipper that only has access from the outside. The two bars that hold the canopy up are padded and strong. It keeps our boy safe and minimizes the damage he causes when he self-injures. Rose Morris designed the Safety Sleeper to keep her son with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from wandering at night. This story fuels my admiration for user-centered design.</p>
          <p>As a digital marketer, I often work with business owners looking to connect with their audience and who often fail to do so. Poor designs that don't meet the needs of their intended audience is what spurred me to learn more about UX design. Users and consumers are the heroes of their journey. Too often businesses neglect to prioritize their users or think they know what their audience already wants.</p>
          <h4>"Accessibility and well-thought out design are my consistent goals."</h4> 
          <p>Being the mother to a special-needs child has made my empathy grow and it's something I've leaned in to. How can we see this from someone else's perspective? Do we know our users or are we just making assumptions about what we think they want?</p>
          <p>Continuous feedback and conversations with users is how I level up the accessibility of the design. It's not about how nice something looks. It's how can we make this more intuitive.</p>
          <p>Not every product is going to be what the Safety Sleeper was to me. Maybe it's a video game you want to splurge on or office supplies you need to buy for your business. Either way, there's a connection to be made.</p>
          <p><b>Let's make those connections.</b></p>
